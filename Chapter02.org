* Auditory Input Model

To understand the auditory system, one must first understand the transformations
preceding neural signals in the auditory nerve. Mechanical vibrations at the
eardrum (tympanic membrane) are conducted by the middle ear bones to vibrations
of fluid in the inner ear (cochlea). They are then transferred to chemical
signals in the inner hair cells and then to electrical potentials of the \ANFs.

# \note{needs references and further expansion.
#   Introduce new acronyms and keywords here eg. tonotopic.  Be careful not to
#   reproduce stuff done in the results chapters }
# This processing also enters a bottle-neck at the auditory nerve,
#  selectivity), referred to as `tonotopy'

\ANFs project to the \CN in a tonotopic fashion
\citep{Feldman:1969,Fekete:1984,Liberman:1991,LeakeSnyderEtAl:1993}. They
bifurcate after passing the central nervous system barrier to innervate
the \VCN and \DCN
\citep{Lorente:1981,Liberman:1991}. Based on their cell bodies,
myelination and prevalence, \ANFs are categorised as type I (large,
myelinated and highly prevalent) and type II (small, unmyelinated and
less prevalent).  The dominant type I \ANFs are further categorised as
\HSR and \LSR fibres. \HSR fibres have a low threshold to tones and have
limited dynamic range (saturating to tones of moderate sound levels)
\citep{SachsYoung:1979}.  \LSR fibres have a higher threshold to
stimulus sound level, and have a monotonic response to increasing sound
levels.  \LSR fibres also project to the \GCD
\citep{Liberman:1993,RyugoParks:2003,RyugoHaenggeliEtAl:2003} along with
the smaller, unmyelinated type II \ANFs \citep{HurdHutsonEtAl:1999},
which suggests they play a different role in sound processing to \HSR
fibres.


# Auditory processing enters an information bottle-neck at the auditory
# nerve. All \ANFs terminate in the \CN .  At this point, a group of highly
# specialised heterogeneous neurons in the \CN process the incoming information
# in several feature-based information pathways \citep{CantBenson:2003}. These
# include the high temporal acuity pathway (bushy cells); the onset detection
# pathway (octopus cells); the azimuth detection pathway (pyramid cells of the
# DCN); and the robust spectral pathway (\TS cells).
# \note{ have included auditory nerve inputs with the appropriate features described
# above. The most recent \AN models include all observed phenomenological
# behaviours in \ANFs.  periphery models are necessary as inputs.  }

The above-mentioned characteristics of \ANFs are essential as input to models of
the \CN.  To examine the properties of a detailed neural model of the \CN, a
phenomenologically-realistic auditory model is required to represent sounds and
transformations that occur in the central auditory system.  Simple attempts to
recreate rate-level behaviour in \ANFs \citep[e.g.~][]{SachsWinslowEtAl:1989}
are not sufficient to reproduce complex non-linear behaviours when dealing with
arbitrary stimuli
\citep{LeakeSnyderEtAl:1993,ArnesenOsen:1978,CloptonWinfieldEtAl:1974}.  Since
those early efforts, there has been great advancement in auditory periphery
models; for an extensive review see \citet{Lopez-Poveda:2005}.


The \AN input model in the \CNSM\space model is called the Carney \AN model,
where each version is derived from the original model of low \CF fibres
\citep{Carney:1993}.
# Motivated by observing ANF phenomena,
Carney and colleagues have made a series of improvements to the original model over the
last 20 years
\citep{ZhangHeinzEtAl:2001,HeinzZhangEtAl:2001,BruceSachsEtAl:2003,ZilanyBruce:2006,ZilanyBruce:2007,ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009,ZilanyCarney:2010}.
# The Zhang model \citep{ZhangHeinzEtAl:2001}, the ARLO model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} and the Bruce model
# \citep{BruceSachsEtAl:2003,ZilanyBruce:2006,ZilanyBruce:2007}, and the Zilany model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009,ZilanyCarney:2010}.
\citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated cochlear filters based on the critical
bandwidths obtained from psychophysical experiments, improving the non-linear
compression and two-tone suppression behaviour in the model. Chapter
\ref{sec:GAChapter} uses this model exclusively. \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007},
version 5, added a parallel signal control path and its predictions have matched
a wide range of physiological data in normal and impaired cat studies. 
Version 6 was developed by \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} and includes an
additional power-law synapse model,
# , with internal fractional Gaussian noise,
which enhances the temporal recovery behaviour in \ANFs.  Versions 5
\citep{ZilanyBruce:2007} and 6 \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} of the Carney AN
model are used in Chapters \ref{sec:ModelChapter} and \ref{sec:AMChapter}.


# \citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated cochlear filters based on
# the critical bandwidths obtained from psychophysical experiments in humans.
# The \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007} model improved the previous AN model by an additional signal path and
# its predictions have matched a wide range of physiological data in normal and
# impaired cat data.

# Chapter \ref{sec:GAChapter} uses the ARLO model
# \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} and Chapters \ref{sec:ModelChapter} and
# \ref{sec:AMChapter} use the Zilany model
# \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009,ZilanyCarney:2010}.
#  \medskip{}

#  \note{Why is it the cat model? updating Carney model?} Updating of the
#  Carney auditory model has led to the change in the model's configuration from an
#  original implementation of the rat model.  The default species is the cat and
#  will be used in the data presented in this chapter.

Figure \ref{fig:ZilanyBruceFig} shows the schematics of the Zilany version of
the Carney AN model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009,ZilanyCarney:2010}.  The Carney AN
model consists of an outer/middle ear pre-processing filter, a cochlear
filterbank, \IHC to \AN synapse model and dead-time modified Poisson spike
generator \citep{ZhangHeinzEtAl:2001}. \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} improved the classic
\citet{WestermanSmith:1988} three-store diffusion model of the IHC-AN synapse
with dual power-law adaptation models and the inclusion of fractional Gaussian
noise.
# Further details of the Zilany AN model are
# explained in \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} and \citet{ZilanyCarney:2010}.



** Frequency Channels

The organisation of the auditory system is described as ``tonotopic'' after the
continuous logarithmic frequency tuning along the basilar membrane
\citep{Greenwood:1990}.  The \CF of \ANFs is typical of the resonant frequency
of the adjacent basilar membrane and forms a topographical receptive field,
according to place along the central auditory nervous system.

The input auditory models used in this thesis mimic the major
phenomenological qualities of experimentally recorded \ANFs.
# The Zilany model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} was based on many auditory models
# from the Carney Lab
# \citep{HeinzColburnEtAl:2001,ZhangCarney:2001,Carney:1993}.
The centre frequencies across $N_{\rm channels}$ is determined by the
logarithmic Greenwood function \citep{Greenwood:1990} of the basilar
membrane in cats.
Centre frequencies of the channels were spaced logarithmically according
to the basilar membrane frequency-place map function, Equation
\ref{eq:Methods:Greenwood} \citep{Greenwood:1990}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:Greenwood}
f(x) = A \left(10^{ax/L} - k\right) \quad (\text{Hz})
\end{equation}
\noindent where $x$ is the distance along the basilar
membrane from the stapes, and variables /A/, /a/, /L/ and /k/ are
dependent on the species.  The data in Table
\ref{tab:Methods:Greenwood} show the currently accepted parameters for
humans, cat and rat.


The range and number of frequency channels used in the auditory filterbank is
defined in each of the following chapters. These parameters set the
level of spatial resolution required in the network model. An increase in
the number of frequency channels greatly increases the computational load
and simulation time in the \AN input generation and \CNSM model.
The model reproduces responses for 50 high and 30 low
\SR\space \ANFs in each frequency channel, across the frequency range 200 Hz
to 64 kHz.

** Inner and Outer Hair Cell Compression

The most recent AN model incorporates species-specific compression functions of
outer and \IHC to facilitate accurate audiograms in the ANFs
\citep{ZilanyCarney:2010,ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  Figure \ref{fig:Compression}
shows the implementation of the compression functions of the inner and outer ear
for the cat and rat.  The acoustic thresholds of the cat and rat
\citep{HeffnerKoayEtAl:2001} were obtained from [[http://earlab.bu.edu]].

** High and Low Spontaneous Rate Fibres
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:Methods:HSRLSR
:END:

The level of spontaneous activity and minimum thresholds in \ANFs are separated
into two distinct groups, \HSR and \LSR fibres
\citep{Schmiedt:1989,Liberman:1993,Liberman:1978,WangPowersEtAl:1997}.
The spontaneous rate of \HSR and \LSR fibers were set to 50 Hz and 0.5 Hz,
respectively.  \HSR and \LSR\space \ANFs were simulated for each frequency
channel.  The stimulus was passed through the \AN model for each frequency
channel for both \LSR and \HSR fibres, producing an instantaneous firing rate
response that was down-sampled to 20 kHz.

# \note{discuss ANF SR, types of ANF, long-term dependence, and
#   standard results of spiking models, and how Jackson then Zilany
#   have tried to fit these to the AN data}

The spiking neural model used in the \ANFs (and the
Golgi cell model in Chapters \ref{sec:ModelChapter}-\ref{sec:AMChapter}) are
inhomogeneous Poisson processes with refractory effects. These
properties are typical of \ANFs
\citep{JacksonCarney:2005,HeilNeubauerEtAl:2007}.  Spike times were generated
independently for each \HSR and \LSR fibre from the instantaneous firing
rate using a pseudo-random Poisson spike generator
\citep{JacksonCarney:2005}, with refractory effects similar
to those present in \ANFs.  The double exponential relative refractory
functions, specific to ANFs, were
\begin{eqnarray}
y_0(t) &= c_0 \exp(-(t'-t_{\textrm{a}})/s_0) \\
y_1(t) &= c_1 \exp(-(t'-t_{\textrm{a}})/s_1),
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where $t'$ is the time relative to the last
spike, $c_0 = 0.5$, $c_1 = 0.5$, $s_0 = 0.001$ msec and $s_1 = 0.0125$
msec.  The absolute refractory period, $t_{\textrm{a}}$, was 0.75 msec.
# Improvements in the spike-generation method
Spike trains for each Poisson-based neural model in the CNSM model were created at the start of each
repetition of the stimulus.

# \note{Para: Notes from Hegger: discuss Poisson generator}
# # $$r(t) = \alpha [V(t)-V_{\mathrm th}]$$
# where
# # $$\mathrm{P}\left{ n \mathrm{spike during}  (t_1,t_2)\right} = e^{\langle{}n\rangle}\frac{(\langle{}n\rangle)^n}{n!} \approx r(t)\delta{}t$$ then refractory effects; then renewal process PDF
# \begin{equation}
# p(\tau) = (\kappa{}r)^{\kappa} \tau^{\kappa-1} e^{-\kappa{} r \tau} / (\kappa - 1)!
# \end{equation}

# \note{Real neuronal spike generation is highly reliable and deterministic, as has been demonstrated by countless numbers of \textit{in vitro} studies. }

# Complex time-varying currents, injected into neurons in rat cortex
# slices, resulted in spike trains were reproducible across repeats to
# less than 1 msec \citep{MainenSejnowski:1995}.  The noise in
# \textit{in vivo} neural responses is believed to result from the fact
# that synapses are very unreliable. In fact, greater than half of the
# arriving presynaptic nerve impulses fail to evoke a post-synaptic
# response \citep[e.g.,~][]{AllenStevens:1994}. The noise in the synapses,
# not in the spike generator!




# Analysis of the frequency
#  response area of ANF generates known parameters for each fibre, these are:
#  \begin{itemize}
#  \item the spontaneous rate (SR), generated in silence and is
#    categoried into two groups High SR ($>$18 sp/s) and Low SR ($<$ 18
#    sp/s);
#  \item threshold, the sound pressure level(SPL) at which the cell
#    responds above the spontaneous rate
#  \item characteristic frequency (CF)
#  \end{itemize}

Single compartment conductance models, similar to those presented by
\citet{HodgkinHuxley:1952a}, were used to model the \CN neurons.
The dynamics of the membrane voltage, $V(t)$, is described by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:V}
C_{m} \frac{dV}{dt} = - \gleak (V - \Eleak) - \INa - \IKHT - \IKLT - \IKA - \Ih - \sum \ISYN,
\end{equation} \noindent where $C_{m}$ is the specific membrane capacitance; \gleak
is the specific leak conductance with associated leak reversal potential \Eleak;
\INa is the sodium current density; \IKHT, \IKLT, and \IKA are three types of
potassium current densities; \Ih is a hyperpolarization-activated current
density; and \ISYN are synaptic input current densities.  The compartmental
nature of the neural model and the voltage measured in millivolts means that
conductance is measured in Seimens per centimetre squared (\Scmsq) and the
membrane capacitance in micro Farads per centimetre squared.

The voltage-dependent relationship in each current model has a peak
conductance parameter and gating variables for activation and
de-activation.  The formula for the sodium current, \INa, was based on
the studies of \citet{Costa:1996} and \citet{BelluzziSacchiEtAl:1985}
and given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:INa}
\INa(t,V)=\gNa m^{3} h (V - \ENa),
\end{equation} \noindent where $m$ is the activation function, $h$ is
the de-activation function, \gNa is the maximum sodium conductance, and
(V - \ENa) is the relative potential between the membrane voltage and
the sodium reversal potential.  The sodium current in \VCN neurons has
not been measured, but measurements in other mammalian neurons were
deemed sufficient for use in the model.

The potassium and mixed-cation current models
used here were drawn from an investigation of isolated \VCN neurons
/in vitro/ \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}, which
yielded accurate mathematical descriptions of:
 - the high-threshold rectifying potassium current
   density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:IKHT}
\IKHT(t,V)= \gKHT (\varphi n^{2} + (1-\varphi ) p)(V - \EK )
\end{equation}
 - the fast-activating transient potassium current
  density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:IKA}
\IKA(t,V)=\gKA a^{4} b c (V -  \EK)
\end{equation}
 - the low-threshold, fast-activating, slowly-deactivating potassium
   current density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:IKLT}
   \IKLT(t,V)=\gKLT w^{3} z (V-\EK)
\end{equation}
 - the mixed-cation hyperpolarization-activated current
   density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:Ih}
\Ih(t,V)=\gh r (V-\Eh).
\end{equation}
The formal equations of the activation and deactivation functions are shown in the Appendix
(Section \ref{sec:Apdx:RMCurrents}).


Figure \ref{fig:Methods:RM2} shows the voltage-dependent relationship of the
activation function and time constants in potassium currents (\IKLT and \IKHT)
from each of the previous \VCN neural models.  The threshold for the activation
variable of \IKLT, $w^\lambda$, is below the \RMP around -65 mV.  Only \IKHT is
present in regular firing (current-clamp type I) units, and behaves as a
rectifier by activating when the membrane voltage rises above -20 mV during an
\AP.  The active voltage-dependent activation and deactivation functions
(/a, b, c, h, m, n, p, r, w/ and /z/) are described in detail by
\citet{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b} and the [[latex:progname][NEURON]]
source code is available online at neural model database [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb][ModelDB]]

Membrane and synapse channels are temperature dependent and most \CN /in vitro/
experiments are performed at room temperature, 22\degC.  All simulations in this
thesis were performed at body temperature, 37\degC. Accordingly, modification of the
appropriate variables had to be performed. This included activation and
deactivation time constants, and maximum conductance of the currents.
For any variable, /x/, the temperature scaling is performed by
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  x = x / {\rm Q}_{10}^{\Delta{}T},
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
where $\Delta{}T$ is the temperature difference in degrees Celsius and Q_10 is the
temperature coefficient calculated at a temperature difference of 10 \degC.
Temperature scaling of each membrane current's activation and deactivation time
constant parameters was calculated with $Q_{10}=3.0$.  Maximum conductance
parameters, $\bar{g}$, were adjusted with temperature coefficient $Q_{10}=2.0$,
except for \Ih which had a temperature coefficient $Q_{10}=1.3$.

** Neural Sub-types in the Cochlear Nucleus


Table \ref{tab:Methods:CellTypes} shows the maximum conductances, $\bar{g}$, for
each cell type in the network.  The neurons in the ventral \CN differ in their
composition of these currents on the basis of their current-clamp type. They are
classified as either type I or type II based on their response to intracellular
current injection \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988}. The response of type I neurons to
current injection is regularly spaced \APs. \TV \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b} and
Golgi cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} are classic type I, and have
\INa, \IKHT and \Ih currents. \TS cells are type I, and they have additional
A-type transient potassium channels, \IKA
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,RothmanManis:2003b}.


Type II responses have only one phasic \AP at the start of the stimulus,
characteristic of ventral \CN bushy cells, which enables them to rapidly follow
\ANF input events \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988,SmithRhode:1989}. \IKLT is present in
type II units and is active at resting membrane potential, which allows for rapid
changes depending on the input. \DS cells respond with a single \AP for injected
current levels near threshold, and then discharge regularly for higher current
levels \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988,PaoliniClark:1999}, corresponding to an
intermediate type I-II response. \DS cells have a small amount of \IKLT current
to reduce the cells' input resistance and enhance coincidence detection.

In the \CNSM model, the membrane parameters were developed and refined after we
established the /in vitro/ characteristics of each cell type from the literature
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,OertelWuEtAl:1988,ZhangOertel:1993b}.

* Connectivity and Topology: Network Organisation in the Cochlear Nucleus Stellate Microcircuit Model
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Methods:ConnectivityandTopology
   :END:


Like many neural networks in the brain, the likelihood of connectivity
between two cells in the \CN is a function of distance, cell type, and
spatial spread of dendrites.  Connectivity between cells in a
post-synaptic group onto individual cells is described by a synaptic
strength or weight, /w/, the number of synapses, /n/, and the spatial
spreading parameter, /s/, which were taken to be uniform across the
network for each connection type.  The allocation of pre-synaptic cells
to post-synaptic cells was random based upon a Gaussian function, with
mean equal to the post-synaptic cell's \CF channel and standard
deviation $\sigma^2=s$ (in channel units).
# Connection
# parameters that are fixed are shown in Table
# \ref{tab:Methods:GeneralParams} and parameters used in the optimisation are
# shown in Table \ref{tab:Methods:Genome}.


The basic unit of sensory networks is the place-channel or feature-channel of
the microcircuit, which separates the receptive field into independent adjacent
groups. The creation of neural microcircuits based on ``place'' is easily
amenable to different sensory neural network models; however, attention to a
given network's unique features is necessary to ensure realistic representation
of the system.  In the \CNSM model, one isofrequency channel receives afferent
input from the narrowest receptive field possible in the \AN model.
Figure \ref{fig:MicroCN} shows the intra-nuclei microcircuit connections and
connectivity type (neurotransmitter and receptor type) in the \CNSM model based
on existing experimental evidence in mammals.  Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter}
provides more detail regarding the evidence for each of the connections in the
microcircuit.

Connection variables between cell types are generally uniform across the
network but may be adjusted to suit the model.
# In the \CNSM model, assumptions were made based on population average data.
Model parameters may be different between species or within species;
therefore, in the absence of adequate evidence regarding exact neuron to neuron
connections, average population data were used.  Issues also arise at the
ends of large-scale topographic \BNNs with overlapping (place)
channel connections.  Boundaries are considered closed bookends, where
post-synaptic neurons select only from those within their connection range.
# The best modelling behaviour would arise, therefore, in the middle sections.

The probability of pre-synaptic to post-synaptic connection is defined as a
Gaussian probability distribution.  The distribution is centred on the
post-synaptic cell's position, /i/, with an optional offset parameter, /o/, in
this case frequency channels.  Figure \ref{fig:MicrocircuitConn} shows the
method used in the \CNSM model for establishing Gaussian spread of connections
between cell types.

#  The channels are separated using the same Greenwood function as used for the AN filterbank.

Network parameters that control the connectivity between two cell type
groups are defined as follows:
- $\mathbf{w}_{\textrm{{X}}\to\textrm{{Y}}}$ ::  The synaptic weight of
     the post-synaptic current influx caused by the pre-synaptic cells
     neurotransmitter activating the receptor channels of the
     post-synaptic cell.  This value may be either uniform for all
     synapses across the connection type or defined by a
     function of the receptive field.
- $\mathbf{n}_{\textrm{{X}}\to\textrm{{Y}}}$ :: The total number of synaptic
     connections on post-synaptic cells from pre-synaptic cells.
- $\mathbf{s}_{\textrm{{X}}\to\textrm{{Y}}}$ :: The spatial or feature-specific
     spread of connections from pre-synaptic cells onto post-synaptic cells.  The
     spread parameter, /s/, is half the variance of the Gaussian function, thus has
     standard deviation $\sigma^2 = 2s$. The distributions are uniform across the
     \CNSM network, which ignores channels outside the network's range.  A
     spread of zero means all connections come from the same frequency channel.
- $\mathbf{o}_{\textrm{{X}}\to\textrm{{Y}}}$ :: The offset in distribution of
     connections between pre-synaptic cell types and post-synaptic cells.  The
     offset variable adjusts the centre point of the probability distribution,
     $\mathcal{N}(i + \mathbf{o}, \sqrt{\mathbf{s}/2})$, away from the
     post-synaptic cell's position, /i/.
- $\mathbf{d}_{\textrm{{X}}\to\textrm{{Y}}}$ :: The temporal delay between a
     pre-synaptic cell's \AP trigger and the onset of the post-synaptic current.
     This delay incorporates the axonal conduction delay and diffusion time
     across the synaptic cleft.  In a single-compartment model, additional delay
     can also be used to represent dendritic delay.


# New limitations of place-based connectivity

# Table \ref{tab:Methods:GeneralParams}).  Physiological evidence in the
# Golgi cell domain of the ventral \CN shows that neurons have monotonic,
# non-saturating rate-level curves, similar to \LSR\space \ANFs
# \citep{GhoshalKim:1996a}. \ANF labeling evidence shows the absence of
# \HSR\space \ANFs in the Golgi cell domain of the \CN
# \citep{Liberman:1991,Ryugo:2008,RhodeOertelEtAl:1983}, so the strength
# of Golgi excitation was given by \wLSRGLG and \nLSRGLG. Wide-band
# inhibition of \TV cells by \DS cells includes an additional channel
# offset, \oDSTV, to account for the asymmetry of wideband suppression
# found in \TV cells \citep{ReissYoung:2005}.  The offset was added to the
# Gaussian mean in the random allocation process.

# The connectivity of the cell types involved in the stellate microcircuit is
# shown in Figure \ref{fig:MicroCN} and in wider scale in Figure
# \ref{tab:MicrocircuitConn}.

\ANFs with similar \CFs were spatially organised into $N_{\textrm{Channel}}$
isofrequency lamina or channels, which translated to frequency channels in the
\CN.  The dendrites of \TS and \TV cells are located within the isofrequency lamina
of the \VCN and \DCN, respectively. The receptive field and bandwidth of \TS and
\TV cells are also similar to \ANFs of similar \CF.  In the \CNSM model, synapse
inputs to these cells were chosen from \ANFs within the same frequency channel
(i.e.\space spread of zero, $s=0$). \DS cells have many arborisations extending
perpendicular to \ANF axons and have a typical physiological responses to
frequencies 2 octaves below and 1 octave above their \CF
\citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,PaoliniClark:1999}.  


# Auditory nerve projections
# to each \CN cell type shared the same synaptic weight, \w, but \HSR and
# \LSR fibres have different parameters encoding the number of inputs
# (e.g. $\nHSRTS$, $\nLSRTS$).
Fast, glycinergic inhibition from \TV cells and
\DS cells (Figure \ref{fig:MicroCN}) is involved in modulating the firing
rate and spike interval variability in \TS cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,WickesbergOertel:1993}.
\TV cells in the deep
layer of the dorsal \CN provide a delayed narrowband inhibition to \TS and \DS
cells in the \VCN.
The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the
 \CN, contributing to this cell's wide frequency
response. In turn this cell is responsible for altering the frequency responses
in \TS and \TV cells \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  \DS cells are coincidence
detectors and have a precisely timed onset response that affects the temporal
properties of \TS cells \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005,RhodeGreenberg:1994a} and
completely inhibits \TV cell responses to loud clicks
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.


GABAergic synapses are present in each of the cells in the \CNSM model.
Inhibition from GABA cells modulates the level of excitation necessary to reach
threshold for all \CN cells
\citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Feedback circuits
from the olivary complex to the ventral \CN are also known to use \GABA as a
neurotransmitter \citep{SaintMorestEtAl:1989}, however only the Golgi cell was
included the \CNSM model.

** Synapse Models
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Methods:SynapseModels
   :END:

Synapses were modeled with either a single or a double exponential
time-dependent conductance change.  The current density equation used was
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SYN}
\ISYN(t)=g_{{\rm SYN}} (t)  (V - E_{{\rm rev}}),
\end{equation} \noindent where $E_{\rm rev}$ is the associated reversal
potential. [[latex:progname][NEURON]]'s conductance synapse model classes [[latex:progname][ExpSyn]] and
[[latex:progname][Exp2Syn]] \citep{HinesCarnevale:2000} were used in the \CNSM model.
The strength of the synapses was
determined by a normalised conductance kernel with decay
time-constants and a multiplicative weight parameter, /w/, as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Methods:11} g_{{\rm Exc}} (t) = w_{{\rm Exc}}  \exp(-t/\tau _{{\rm Exc}} ) \quad (\uS) \\
\label{eq:Methods:12} g_{{\rm Inh}} (t) = w_{{\rm Inh}} \,\eta\, \left( \exp(-t/\tau_{{\rm Inh2}} )- \exp(-t/\tau _{{\rm Inh1}} )\right) \quad (\uS)
\end{eqnarray} \noindent where $\eta$ normalises the peak of the
double-exponential function to 1. Normalisation factor, $\eta$, for double
exponential synapse model
\citep{HinesCarnevale:2000} is given by
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{1}{-\exp(t'/\tau_{Inh1})+\exp(t'/\tau_{inh2})}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}
t'=\frac{\tau_{Inh1}\tau_{Inh2}}{\tau_{Inh2}-\tau_{Inh1}} \ln(\tau_{Inh2}/\tau_{Inh1}).
\end{equation}

Excitatory inputs to \CN cells from type I \ANF terminals were mediated
by fast glutamatergic-\AMPA receptors
\citep{Gardner:2000,GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}. Spontaneous \EPSPs in \VCN \DS and \TS neurons
had a decay time constant of $\tAMPA = 0.36$ msec \citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}. \TV cells
the \DCN had a decay time constant of $\tAMPA = 0.40$ msec
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}.  The reversal potential of the excitatory
synapse was 0 mV.

Double exponential inhibitory synapses used in the network were derived from
\IPSPs in glycinergic and GABAergic synapses.  The \GlyR is
the fastest inhibitory synapse in the mammalian brain and is blocked by the
neurotoxin strychnine.  The \GlyR synapse model was based on miniature glycinergic
\IPSPs recorded in mature \AVCN in rats and mice
\citep{LimOleskevichEtAl:2003} and in rat \MNTB neurons
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2004,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}.  Room temperature
whole cell patch recordings of spontaneous 
\IPSCs in mature \AVCN in rats and
mice neurons showed these synapses have a fast rise time (10\% to 90\%),
$\tGlyone = 0.4$ msec, and a decay time constant $\tGlytwo = 2.5$ msec
\citep{LimOleskevichEtAl:2003}.  In \MNTB rat neurons at body temperature, GlyR
decay constants of miniature and evoked \IPSCs were $0.8 \pm 0.2$ msec and $1.1 \pm 0.2$ 
msec (37\degC), respectively \citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2004}.  \GABAa
synapses were modeled from \MNTB recordings in mature guinea pigs
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}.  \GABAa receptor currents have a fast (9
msec) and a slow (150 msec) decay component
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,DavisYoung:2000}, but for short stimuli only
the fast component was modeled ($\tGABAone =0.7$ msec, $\tGABAtwo =9.0$
msec). Chlorine reversal potential in \GlyR and \GABAa receptors was set to
-75 mV.


** Delay and Latency Variables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Methods:DelayLatency
   :END:

For the \CNSM model, delay was defined as the time between activation of the
pre-synaptic neuron and the activation of the post-synaptic potential, which
includes axonal conduction and synaptic diffusion. Synaptic transmission and
axonal conductance delay between adjacent neurons is typically measured in
experiments to be 0.4 -- 0.5 msec. Delays between neurons in the ventral and
\DCN were measured using electric shocks and found to be approximately 1.0
msec, but ranged from 0.15 to 2 msec \citep{WickesbergOertel:1993}.
# \note{Needs reference, and what about Bahlmer and Lagner's 0.4 msec delays}


Latency was defined in the \CNSM model as the time difference between a stimulus
of reference event and the mean activation of the post-synaptic neuron.  The
formula for the latency of acoustic stimulation to the mean \FSL in \ANFs was
first derived by \citet{CarneyYin:1988}. \citet{CarneyYin:1988} fitted the \ANF
first spike latency against the \CF of the fibres in cats from click responses
in the cat to obtain the formula:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Methods:delay}
d=A_{0} \exp(-x/A_{1})\times 10^{- 3} - 1/{\mathrm{CF}_x},
\end{equation} \noindent 
where /x/ is the distance along the basilar membrane
from the apex, ${\mathrm{CF}}_x$ is the \CF (Hz) at this location, and constants
$A_0$ and $A_1$ are 8.3 msec and 6.49 cm for cats, respectively.

# In humans, \citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} corrected the peak click to
# match the onset delay of ANFs, generating a latency function :
# \begin{equation} \label{eq:delayhumans}
# d(x) = 4.915 + 0.3631 \times \exp(0.11324 \times x),\quad 5\, <\, x\, <\, 35 \quad (\mathrm{mm})
# \end{equation}
#  where $A_0 = 3.0$, $A_1 = 12.5$.
# the cat latency function was used in the rat \AN implementation has been retained in the model used here
# \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.

The latency of \CN neurons is not only affected by the properties of the basilar
membrane, but also by the twisting of axons by the spiral ganglion neurons and
the organised innervation of the \CN by the same fibres.  Consequently, an
additional delay parameter is required that combines the intrinsic \ANF delay
and the effective axonal conductance to the \CN neurons.  Mean first spike
latency to click stimuli was used in Section \ref{sec:Ch3:Delays} to set the
delay times between \ANFs and \CN cells.
#  \citep{EagerGraydenEtAl:2006}.
# The delay parameter was
# fitted using the first spike latency of high frequency units as the sum of the
# \ANFs' first spike latency, \ANF conduction delay, and the synaptic transmission
# delay.

** Simulation Environment

Neural models and network connections were generated using the neural simulation
package [[latex:progname][NEURON]] \citep{CarnevaleHines:2006}. NMODL, an extension of [[latex:progname][NEURON]]
\citep{HinesCarnevale:2000}, was used to implement membrane current models and
interface with the \AN model.  The \AN model and the neural cell models were combined into the \CNSM software
code called [[latex:progname][cnstellate]] (in preparation for open-source online access).  This
code is implemented in [[latex:progname][NEURON]], [[latex:progname][NMODL]] and [[latex:progname][C]] source code, and plotting scripts in
gnuplot and [[latex:progname][MATLAB]].  
Numerical integration was performed using the
Crank-Nicholson method with second order accuracy (in [[latex:progname][NEURON]], $secondorder=2$)
and fixed time step of either 0.1 or 0.05 msec.


The computations of the [[latex:progname][NEURON]] model were distributed on a single
personal computers (PC); a cluster of nine PCs (3.0 GHz Intel Pentium4)[fn:: Systems
provided by the Department of Otolaryngology, the University of
Melbourne.]; an SGI Altix system (=soma=: 64 32-bit Itanium

The parallel capabilities of the network model presented in Chapter
\ref{sec:ModelChapter} were based on the NEURON network model [[latex:progname][netmod]] (see
other neural models that also use =netmod= at [[http://modeldb.senselab.yale.edu][ModelDB]], particularly

** Stimulus Generation and Analysis

In order to emulate sound entering the ear, acoustic sounds were generated and
passed into the auditory model.  The acoustic stimuli were generated in [[latex:progname][NEURON]],
with the exception of notch noise, which was generated in [[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]].
The stimulus types included pure tones, white noise, sinusoidal
amplitude modulated sounds and clicks.
Sound levels are given in decibel SPL (i.e., root
mean square of pressure levels in dB re 20 $\mu\textrm{Pa}$).
# Bursts of wideband noise (bandwidth 20 kHz, spectral density
# The first run of a stimulus may take some time if the AN responses have not been previously saved.


Temporal resolution in the \CNSM model is variable at each stage: the stimulus,
the \ANF spiking model, and the [[latex:progname][NEURON]] simulation.  The stimulus sampling rate
of version 4 of the Carney auditory model was 50 kHz
\citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001}.  The middle ear filter in the Bruce model
\citep{ZilanyBruce:2007,BruceSachsEtAl:2003,ZilanyBruce:2006} required a
sampling rate of 500 kHz in the stimulus. The Zilany model
\citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} improved the processing to allow for a stimulus
sampling rate of 200 kHz for \CFs above 20 kHz; 100 kHz sampling was used for
other \CFs.
# Version 4 of the AN model
# \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} was sampled at 100 kHz for \CF units below
# 20 kHz, otherwise a sampling rate of 200 kHz was used.

In the \CNSM model, the instantaneous rate output profiles of all \AN models was
down-sampled to a lesser sampling rate for the \ANF spike generator and saved
for further use.  The resolution of the spike generator was either 20 or 50
kHz. The integration time-step of the NEURON simulations was 0.05 msec.

Notch noise was used as the stimulus for Chapter \ref{sec:GAChapter} and the
optimisation of \DS cell connections to \TV cells (see Section
\ref{sec:Ch3:DSTV} in Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter}).  Notch noise was
generated from Gaussian white noise filtered using a stop-band filter in
[[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]].  The notch noise sample was stored in a file so that it could
be retrieved by NEURON in the simulation.

#  with a
# 50 kHz sampling frequency and filtered with a quarter octave, 30 dB
# band-stop, 100-tap FIR filter centered at 5 kHz. A 50 msec stimulus was
# presented at 60 dB \SPL with 5 msec onset/offset ramps, a 20 msec delay and
# 10 msec pause after the stimulus. Notch noise stimuli have been used in
# experimental studies of the \CN to measure the asymmetric, wide-band
# suppression of \TV cells by \DS cells \citep{ReissYoung:2005} and to
# estimate the frequency range of \ANFs converging on \DS cells
# \citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.


# ** Creation and Simulation of CNSM Model



# \note{show organisation of frequency channels, input and microcircuit }
# The tonotopic organisation of the model was built into N_{\rm channel} frequency
# channels (from CF_{\rm low} to CF_{\rm high}) mimicking the population of the \ANF input
# model. This replicates \ANF innervation of the \CN \citep{Lorente:1981}.


# \note{Reference to online access to cnstellate model}

#  The \CN stellate network model drawn in Figure

#      high \CF (left to right).  The model reproduces responses for high
#      and \LSR\space \ANFs at a fixed number of frequency channels across the auditory range of the species being studied.
# 2. Golgi cells :: A \GABA-ergic \VCN marginal shell unit is assumed
#      to regulate excitability in the \GCD and core \VCN units
#      \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Only one /in vivo/ study has
#      recorded extracellular data in the marginal shell area of the \CN
#      \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The presumed characteristics of Golgi
#      cells are taken from that study and are defined by a monotonic
#      response to tones and noise, and an unusual or chopper \PSTH.
# 3. D stellate cells :: A large glycinergic multipolar cell with
#      \OnC\space \PSTH response that acts as a coincidence detector.  Its large
#      dendritic area increases its response to noise, allowing it to
#      behave as a wide-band inhibitor in the \VCN, \DCN and
#      contralateral \CN
#      \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
# 4. Tuberculoventral cells :: A glycinergic, type II \EIRA unit in the
#      deep layer of the \DCN \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  This cell
#      acts as a delayed echo-suppressor and narrow-band inhibitor, with
#      recurrent connections between D and T stellate cells in the \VCN
#      \citep{Alibardi:2006,OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991}.
# 5. T stellate cells :: One of the major output projection cells of

To develop and optimise detailed neural models and their synaptic connections,
reproducible research methods are required. Hand-tuning and gradient-decent
optimisation are commonly used in realistic neural and network models
\citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}, but may have poor replicability.  Parameter
estimation and fitting routines in \BNN models are also becoming more
advanced, for example [[latex:progname][SSNS]] \citep{SichtigSchafferEtAl:2008}, [[latex:progname][NeuroFitter]]
\citep{VanAchardEtAl:2007} and [[latex:progname][MultiRunFitter]] (a feature in NEURON).  In this
thesis, a table method introduced by \citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is used to
summarise the neural models used in each optimisation step to improve
reproduction.  The Nordlie tables shown in Table \ref{tab:ModelSummary} consist
of (i) the model summary; (ii) cell type populations; (iii) connectivity between
two cell types; (iv) neuron and synapse models; and (v) optimisation parameters.
This method provides a consistent and recognisable format for presenting various
neural network models and their constituents.

# \note{this needs more explanation in the methods sections}

The standard methods for optimisation can be simply described with the
following steps:
 1. Specify the function or model to be optimised.
 2. Specify the fitting function to be satisfied.
 3. Specify the parameters that will be adjusted, and any constraints on
    those parameters.
 4. Perform the optimisation.

The fitting function includes specifying the stimulation routine, analysis of neural
outputs and the formula with which to compare simulated results with
experimental data.  The large number of parameters in the \CNSM model created
challenges for realistic optimisation.  The model implementation, the choice of
experimental data and evaluation of the fitness function are important factors
in determining the speed and efficiency of the algorithm.  The following
sections introduce the two optimisation methods used in this thesis to
generate a realistic model of the stellate microcircuit of the \CN.


** Sequential Methods

To create a realistic microcircuit from a wide range of experimental data,
Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter} develops a parameter optimisation routine in
sequential stages.  The network parameters were chosen in the sequential
optimisation stages to encompass synaptic inputs to each individual cell type in
the CN stellate microcircuit. Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter} uses the praxis
method, an algorithm for finding the minimum of a function of several variables
without needing the derivative \citep{Brent:1976}.

# In developing and simulating the detailed neural models and neural network
# models, a reproducible research method was used. The Nordlie approach to
# reproducible neural network simulations \citep{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is
# followed in Table \ref{tab:ModelSummary}.  Tables \ref{tab:ModelSummary}i to
# \ref{tab:ModelSummary}v show the detailed summary of the \CN stellate
# microcircuit used in the simulations performed in Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter}.



** Simultaneous Methods

Chapter \ref{sec:GAChapter} presents a method to optimise the
network parameters in the \CNSM model simultaneously.  New techniques in
multi-unit electrophysiological recording are being developed that are
able to record from multiple neurons simultaneously.  A simultaneous
optimisation method requires complete data from the majority of
neurons in the network, and is therefore is not possible given existing
experimental methods. The method in Chapter \ref{sec:GAChapter}
used surrogate target data by simulating the network with user selected
or randomised parameter values.

# - spike-timing essential, AIV ideal
The optimisation method used in Chapter \ref{sec:GAChapter} is a
derivation of the genetic algorithm method
\citep{Holland:1975,KozaRice:1991}.  The genetic algorithm optimisation
procedure uses operations analogous to natural selection to search for
the optimal solution \citep{Mitchell:1996}.  This procedure is used when
the standard analytical and gradient search methods are ineffective or
computationally expensive.  The basic response properties of the neurons
are used to set the ‘fitness’ criteria of the genetic algorithm.
The design and implementation of the genetic algorithm search method is
discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:GAChapter}.

# The network parameters (i.e. synapse distribution and strength) for
# each known projection will be constrained to physiologically
# significant responses using an iterative optimisation routine based on
# genetic algorithms.  The first stage of optimisation will use an
# isolated network of TS, DS and TV cells.  This stage will not include
# GABAergic input. The isolated network consists of TS cells restricted
# to one frequency channel and DS and TV cells connected from frequency
# channels on and off CF, Figure 9.  The second stage of optimisation
# will insert GABAergic input into the isolated network.  Including
# GABAergic inhibition will alter cell responses and therefore require
# adjustment of network parameters to properly account for physiological
# data.  The final stage of network development will be to combine a
# whole network of cells representing a range of frequencies that will
# be used to test the hypotheses.  The synaptic organisation of the
# expanded network will be based on the parameters of the isolated
# network.




# Figure 9: Isolated Network Model.  A single frequency channel of TS
# cells receiving a narrow band of ANF inputs.  TV and DS cells from
# same frequency channel and in lateral sidebands provide input to TS
# cells.  ANFs contact all cell types in frequency specific fashion.



# Genetic Algorithm design Genetic algorithms (GA’s) provide a
# stochastic global searching method that is most suitable for this
# task.  GA’s are derived from Charles Darwin’s theory of natural
# selection and employ operations analogous to genetic operations
# performed on DNA. The key concepts of GA’s are the parameter set, the
# fitness function and the termination criteria.  The set of parameters
# that we wish to optimise form a string of genes called an individual.
# A population of individuals makes up a generation. New generations are
# created by selecting the best of the population based on some fitness
# measure, then transforming the individuals by a genetic
# operation. Genetic operations allow for the best parameters to be
# retained and also introduce variety and randomness.  The fitness
# function quantifies in a single value how well the individual is
# suited to the environment.  The optimum solution in the genetic
# algorithm is a set of parameters that produce the smallest fitness
# function value.  The variables controlling the algorithm size and
# duration are set at the start of optimisation.  The number of
# individuals in a generation will be set to 100 and the maximum number
# of generations will be set to 20.  The best fitted individual will be
# the champion of that optimisation run.  Sanity checks on the parameter
# set will make sure the values are consistent and realistic.

# The major steps in preparing to use conventional genetic algorithms on fixed-length strings to solve a problem are (Goldberg, 1989):
# determining the representation scheme;
# determining the fitness measure;
# determining the parameters and variables for controlling the algorithms; and
# determining the way of designating the result and criterion for terminating a run.

# The representation scheme will use the parameters in Table 2 to create
# an individual of fixed length.  The fitness measure is discussed in
# detail in the next section.  The fitness will utilise a least squared
# error from the theoretical means of each of the constraint
# parameters. Physiological data from rate-level characteristics,
# synchronisation to amplitude modulated tones and lateral suppression
# observed in masked response curves will form the basis of the
# constraint parameters.  Termination will occur after a fixed number of
# generations or if an individual attains an excellent fitness value.

# The three steps in executing genetic algorithms on fixed length character strings can be summarised as follows (Goldberg, 1989):
# 1. Randomly generate an initial population of individual parameter sets.
# 2. Iteratively perform the sub steps until the termination criteria is satisfied:
# a. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population
# b. Create a new population of strings by applying the operations below.  Select an individual with probability based on fitness.
# i. Reproduction: copy individual to next population.  This operation introduces conservation, to preserve the best-fitted individuals.
# ii. Cross-over: create two new individuals by randomly combining the substrings of two individuals broken at some random point.  This operation introduces variety but retains quality among existing parameter strings.
# iii. Mutation: create a new individual by taking one parameter in the set randomly select a new value.
# 3. The best individual is the set of parameters that generate the best fitness value

# The methods used in the design and implementation of genetic algorithms come from Mitchell (1996) and Goldberg (1989).

# 	Fitness criteria

# 1) Rate-level curve (RLC)
#  The response to increasing intensity of tones at characteristic frequency (CF) is used to quantify a cell’s spontaneous rate, threshold, dynamic range and maximum discharge rate.  RLC’s are classified as monotonic, saturating or non-monotonic depending of their shape, Figure 10.  There is sufficient data on TS, DS and TV cells to obtain population statistics for each of the cell types.

# Tuberculoventral cells:  Shofner and Young 1985; Voigt and Young 1990; Spirou et al. 1999.
# Golgi cells have received less attention because they are located in the marginal shell (Gibson et al. 1985; Ghoshal and Kim, 1997; Kim et al., 1998).

# 2) Synchronisation to Amplitude modulated tones
# The synchronisation to AM tones has been discussed in the introduction.  Table 3: Physiological data used in the fitness function. shows the critical parameters in the tMTFs of stellate neurons that will be used to constrain parameters.
# 3) Lateral suppression in Masked Response Curves

# Cochlear nucleus neurons typically have low spontaneous rates, which
# makes detecting inhibition outside their response area difficult.  A
# masked response curve (MRC) utilises CF tones or noise to excite the
# cell to examine suppressive effects of off-CF tones. The MRC’s
# quantify the strength and bandwidth of lateral inhibition on TS cells
# and TV cells and facilitation in DS cells. Physiological recordings
# using MRC’s are used to constrain the network parameters (CF tone
# masker: Blackburn and Sachs, 1990; Noise masker: Rhode and Greenberg,
# 1994b; OnC facilitation: Palmer and Winter 1996).  Significant
# parameters from MRC’s are shown in Figure 11 along with recorded MRC’s
# from ChS and ChT units in the VCN (Rhode and Greenberg, 1994b)

# Figure 11: Left, description of masked response curve (MRC) parameters. Right, masked response curves using noise maskers in TS cells (ChT and ChS) from Rhode and Greenberg 1994.

# 	Fitness Function

# The physiological response characteristics that will be used to constrain the network are shown in Table 3.  These characteristics will be measured for each network parameter set (i.e. each individual in the genetic algorithm).  A fitness value will be assigned using a normalised least squared error procedure.  Equation 1 shows the fitness function F, for an individual X, with a summation of the least squared error for each constraint parameter.

# ** Separation of Optimisation and Testing Data

# It is important to clarify the separation between physiological data
# used to constrain the network and data used to validate and test
# hypotheses.  The optimisation criteria represent responses to simple
# characteristics that are not directly related to complex response
# characteristics argued by the hypotheses.  The first three hypotheses
# relate to population responses of TS cells to spectrally and
# temporally complex signals such as vowels.  The rate-place and
# temporal representation of vowels provide a completely different set
# of test stimuli that is unrelated to the simple stimuli used for
# optimisation.  The fourth hypothesis relates to psychophysical
# masking, as detected from the threshold of spikes across the
# population of TS cells.  Simultaneous and forward masking experiments
# use simple tone and noise sounds as probes and maskers. The
# characteristic mechanisms for simultaneous masking are indirectly
# related to the lateral suppression mechanisms constrained by the
# optimisation process.  The detection of probe stimuli can utilise the
# responses across the whole population rather than the responses just
# at that frequency.  Hence, this hypothesis is testing the global
# response of a network that produces physiologically characterised
# lateral suppression at the individual cell level.  Forward masking
# uses stimuli separated in time, hence neither rate-level or masked
# response characteristics are related.  Synchronisation to AM tones
# does provide temporal constraints to parameters however this is
# unlikely to affect forward masking response directly.
